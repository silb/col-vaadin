# Contextual Object Lookup (COL) for Vaadin

This library provides a mechanism for decoupling Vaading components at different
levels of the component hierarchy from each other.

The typical scenario where this is needed is when a component deep down in the
hierarchy depends on some other component close to the root of the hierarchy.

The decoupling is provided by an intermediary lookup mechanism which components
down in the hierarchy can use in order to get access to:

 * Components further up in the hierarchy
 * Services
 * Other objects that are shared between two or more components
